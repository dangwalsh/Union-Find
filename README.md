Note to viewers:

These code examples are my personal interpretation of 'Algorithms' 
created by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for their book and 
Coursera course under that same title.  The original ideas were 
expressed in fragments of Java code which I reinterpreted into working 
C++ code as a test of my own knowledge and an understanding of how the
two languages map to each other.

The algorithms themselves are best utilized by setting breakpoints and
stepping through the instructions to observe how they function.
